# Problem Statement
- One of the problem is the rising rate of cancellation in the hotel industry where cancellation rate rose from under 33% in 2014 to 40% in 2018.
- This trend of cancellation also have causes hotel loss in opportunity cost (unsold room due to cancellation)
# Project Goals
- The Goals of this project is to find out the characteristic of customers who cancelled and finding a pattern in cancelled booking by doing an exploratory data analysis
- Building classification machine learning model to predict cancellation.
# Objectives
- Explore the Dataset: Dataset's basic information, summary statistics for numerical and categorical variables.
- Preprocessing: Handle missing values, Handle noisy data, Feature Engineering, Encode categorical variables
- EDA
- Model Building
- Evaluate and compare models


# Conclusion: Hotel Booking Cancellation Prediction
## 1.Problem
- The goal of this project was to develop a machine learning model to predict hotel booking cancellations.
- The dataset contained various features related to hotel bookings, including lead time, arrival date, customer demographics, booking details, and special requests.
## 2.Model Building Process
- Began by exploring and preprocessing the dataset, which included handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and feature engineering. And then experimented with several machine learning algorithms, including Decision Tree, Random Forest, and Logistic Regression. Hyperparameter tuning was performed using GridSearchCV to optimize model performance.
## 3.Model Performance
- The models were evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC AUC. Among the models tested, the Random Forest classifier achieved the highest performance, with an accuracy of 86% and an F1-score of 0.86 on the test set. The ROC AUC score was 0.93, indicating excellent discriminatory power.
## 4.Interpretation of Results
- The Random Forest model demonstrated strong predictive performance for hotel booking cancellations. The model successfully captured complex interactions between features and accurately classified cancellations across different customer segments.
## 5.Conclusion
- The developed Random Forest model provides a valuable tool for hotel managers to predict and manage booking cancellations effectively. This can maximise their revenue and also optimise their operations, enhance customer satisfaction.
