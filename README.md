- This trend of cancellation also have causes hotel loss in opportunity cost (unsold room due to cancellation)
# Project Goals
- The Goals of this project is to find out the characteristic of customers who cancelled and finding a pattern in cancelled booking by doing an exploratory data analysis
- Building classification machine learning model to predict cancellation.
# Objectives
- Explore the Dataset: Dataset's basic information, summary statistics for numerical and categorical variables.
- Preprocessing: Handle missing values, Handle noisy data, Feature Engineering, Encode categorical variables
- EDA
- Model Building
- Evaluate and compare models
